AI Eyes for the Blind
A powerful, real-time assistive system for blind and deaf individuals, using AI models like Gemma 2B, YOLOv8, BLIP, and MiDaS.
🔍 What it does

Describes surroundings using BLIP
Simplifies descriptions for accessibility with Google Gemma
Detects objects and directions with YOLOv8n
Estimates obstacle distances with MiDaS
Converts output to speech via gTTS
Supports video and image inputs
Designed for visually impaired and hearing-impaired users

🧠 Technologies Used

Gemma 2B – Language simplification
YOLOv8n – Real-time object detection
BLIP – Image captioning
MiDaS – Monocular depth estimation
gTTS – Text-to-speech
Gradio – Web interface
OpenCV + NumPy – Image preprocessing
