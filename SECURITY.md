# 🔒 Security & Usage Policy for AI Accessibility Suite

🌟 **Welcome to the AI Accessibility Suite!** This vibrant collection of tools—designed to empower everyone, from visually and hearing-impaired users to kids and general users—is built with love and innovation. To protect the integrity of this project and respect the creator’s vision, we’ve outlined a clear security and usage policy below. Let’s keep accessibility inclusive and respectful! 💪

## 🚫 Unauthorized Use: Respect the Rules!

This project is shared publicly **for transparency, education, and inspiration only**. It’s a beacon of innovation, but there are strict boundaries to ensure its mission stays true.

**You are strictly prohibited from**:

- 🛠️ **Reusing Code**: Using any part of this codebase (e.g., `md.py`, `VocalBridge.ipynb`, `Real Time.ipynb`, `PolyVoice.ipynb`) in your own projects or applications.
- 📋 **Forking or Cloning**: Copying or forking this repository on GitHub or any platform.
- ✏️ **Modifying or Repurposing**: Altering, translating, or adapting the code, design, or assets for any purpose.

- 💼 **Commercial or Academic Use**: Using the project in commercial, academic, or consulting settings without explicit permission.
- 🤖 **AI Training**: Integrating this project into machine learning workflows, datasets, or AI model training (e.g., LLMs, image models).

> **Why?** This project is licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0)**, except for **VocalBridge**, which uses the **MIT License**. These restrictions protect the creator’s rights and ensure the project remains a force for good! 🌍

## ⚠️ Consequences of Violations

Breaking these rules is a **breach of license** and may lead to:

- 📜 **DMCA Takedown**: A formal request to GitHub or other platforms to remove unauthorized forks, clones, or distributions.
- ⚖️ **Legal Action**: Enforcement of copyright to protect the project’s integrity.
- 🚫 **Access Revocation**: GitHub is authorized to remove violating repositories upon request.

Let’s keep the vibe positive and respect the creator’s work! 😊

## 📬 Need Permission? Let’s Talk!

If you have a specific use case (e.g., educational demos, non-commercial research, or accessibility advocacy) and want limited access, reach out for written permission:

- **Owner**: Mohammad Parham Dehghan
- 📧 **Email**: [dehghanparham6@gmail.com](mailto:dehghanparham6@gmail.com)
- 🎥 **YouTube**: [AI Accessibility Projects & Demos](https://www.youtube.com/@dehghanparham6)
- 🧑‍💻 **GitHub**: [@Parham-Dehghan](https://github.com/Parham-Dehghan)

We’re excited to collaborate with those who share our passion for accessibility! 💡

## 🔐 Security Commitment

We take security seriously to protect users, including those with disabilities and kids using our tools. Here’s how we ensure safety:

- 🔒 **Data Privacy**: Uses federated learning and on-device processing to minimize data exposure (e.g., Firebase with GDPR-compliant encryption).
- 🛡️ **Secure Authentication**: Single-sign-on with voice-activated options for motor-impaired users.
- 🧹 **File Management**: Temporary files are cleaned every 10 minutes to prevent data leaks.
- 🌐 **Open but Protected**: Public availability is for transparency, but usage is restricted to maintain integrity.

## 🙌 Join the Accessibility Mission!

This project is all about making the world more inclusive for everyone—blind, deaf, motor-impaired, cognitively impaired, kids, and general users. Respecting this policy helps us keep the focus on empowerment and innovation. Got ideas to make accessibility even better? Drop us a line! 🚀
